## üöÄ About the Project

**AlumConnect** is the flagship project born out of a collaboration between the **DevRhylme open-source community** and the product vision of **Iron Industry**.

> This platform is built to solve a real-world problem‚Äîhelping students get authentic guidance, internships, and network access through verified alumni from their own institutions.

- üõ°Ô∏è **Secure**: Only verified college members & alumni
- üí¨ **Connect**: Messaging, mentorship requests, Q&A
- üìÅ **Opportunities**: Internships, job referrals, campus events

## üîç Why AlumConnect?

Most alumni platforms are outdated, cluttered, or filled with spam.  
AlumConnect is designed to be **lightweight**, **secure**, and **student-first** ‚Äî with actual use cases collected from engineering colleges across India.

We‚Äôre building this in public, open source, and with real feedback.
